# React Native code challenge
You're in charge of building a Todo List App.

We provided the basic wireframes, check the `wireframes` directory.

The App must connect to the graphql API inside the `backend` directory. Check the `README` file and follow the setup instructions.

You can check the graphql playground in `http://localhost:3000/graphql`. All the queries and mutations required for the challenge are in the `graphql` directory.
